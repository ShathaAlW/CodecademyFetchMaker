# CodecademyFetchMaker

FetchMaker is a tech start-up that aims to match up prospective dog owners with their perfect pet

FetchMaker collected data on their adoptable dogs, which includes:
- weight: an integer representing how heavy a dog is in pounds (lbs)
- tail_length: a float representing tail length in inches (inch)
- age: in years
- color: a string
- is_rescue: a boolean 0 or 1
- likes_children: a boolean 0 or 1
- is_hypoallergenic: a boolean 0 or 1
- name: a string
- breed: a string

FetchMaker wants us to:
- get the number of whippet rescued dogs
- get the number of whippets in the data sample
- given that FetchMaker estimates (based on historical data for all dogs) that 8% of dogs in their system are rescues.
  check if whippets are significantly more or less likely than other dogs to be a rescue
- test if there a significant difference in the average weights of thier popular mid-sized dog breeds (whippets, terriers, pitbulls)
- if there is a signifcance difference, determine which pair(s) of dogs has/have the significat difference in average weight
- extra for data visualization: boxplot of weights of each breed type
- extra: checking the range of weight of dog breeds
- test if there is an association between breed (poodle vs. shihtzu) and color
- extra: test, if there is an association between dog breed and being hypoallergenic or not
- extra for data visualization: barplot of dog breeds and being hypoallergenic or not
